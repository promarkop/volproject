# volproject

Website where people can search for the place they are going to travel to and get a list of volunteer associations present in that area, or look for the type of volunteering they want to do and are advised a place to travel, or both.


Community and Sustainability provided by Volunteering which is mutual happiness for the community and the volunteer 

It is supposed to have a review section that allows volunteers rate their experience with the organization. The NGO should be rated as well for the benefits provided to the person.

Since we are in a new reality lately and the world starts working online a lot we are thinking, besides the in-place volunteer, we could add a section which is an online offer for help which we categorized them in the following groups:

Children 
Education (could be a foreign language, or skills)
Creative work-time (fun activities)
Adults
Professional development (skills-knowledge acquiring lessons)
Mental support (psychologists for example)
Health Support
Education
Elders
Creative work
Mental support
Care
